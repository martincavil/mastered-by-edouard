        "Hey. I’m Edouard, a french mastering engineer based in Paris. For me, mastering is not just a technical step, it’s about trust and connection. I like things to be clear, organised, and efficient, so artists can feel confident that the final step of their production will be smooth and precise.",
      description2:
        "What truly drives me is the human side : the conversations, the cultural exchange, and the shared passion for sound. Over the past years, I’ve had the chance to master more than a thousand songs for artists from every corner of the world, and even reach diamond record certification along the way. ",
